<p>
Udiddit, a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website, is currently using a risky and unreliable Postgres database schema to store the forum posts, discussions, and votes made by their users about different topics.</p>
<p>The schema allows posts to be created by registered users on certain topics, and can include a URL or a text content. It also allows registered users to cast an upvote (like) or downvote (dislike) for any forum post that has been created. In addition to this, the schema also allows registered users to add comments on posts.</p>
