APPENDIX: SQL queries used

Create a View called “forestation” by joining all three tables - forest_area, land_area and regions in the workspace.

CREATE VIEW forestation AS 
SELECT  
f.country_code, 
f.country_name, 
f.year, 
forest_area_sqkm, 
total_area_sq_mi, 
total_area_sq_mi*2.59 AS total_area_sqkm, region, 
income_group, 
forest_area_sqkm*100/(total_area_sq_mi*2.59) AS percent_forestation
FROM forest_area AS f
JOIN land_area AS l
ON f.country_code = l.country_code AND f.year = l.year
JOIN regions AS r
ON r.country_code = f.country_code;

1. GLOBAL SITUATION

a. What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 1990? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record denoted as “World" in the region table.
